**What Is W5CAPI ?**

W5CAPI is a real time communication PaaS (Platform as a Service) product that has all the hardware infrastructure and servers in the cloud that enables real-time communication between 2 or more users. The platform is designed with high-level of security, scalability and quality. In order to interface with the platform, W5CAPI provides API to the software developers that can be used in their application to enable real-time communication in their application. When integrated in their application, they will able to perform real time communication, such as instant messaging, voice call, video call, file sharing, and screen sharing, right through their applications.
